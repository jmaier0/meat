# MEtastability Analysis Tool (MEAT)

This tool implements various approaches to determine metastability in electronic circuits. A so called metastable state can be compared to a stick which is balanced on a palm: in the perfect position it will stand upright but only minor disturbance will cause it to approach its actual stable states.

Determining the metastable state is a very challenging task as the system tries to escape it as quickly as possible. Therefore this tools ipmlements some systematic and novel ways to circumvent that property. A detailled analysis of the methods has been published by Maier et al. at ASYNC'19.

Despite designed for characterizing Schmitt Triggers it turned out that the methods are applicable to other circuits as well. This has been already verified for the flip-flop however many more might still be undiscovered.
